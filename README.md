Crestron NVX Matrix Controller with NVX control, and NVX code lua examples.

Quite a lot of refactoring to be done, but has a lot of the functionality required and easy to add more from the api into the code.
Matrix controller allows 18 NVX units to be added and populates a snapshottable table of inputs, has auto-following options (nvx follows another nvx, useful for multiple screens which should show the same content), default routing on boot, etc.

All open code. Standard MIT licence, please attribute to here if you use this code.
